# ü•∑ Stealth Web Injector

A Chrome extension designed to inject minimal, persistent floating UI elements into any webpage while avoiding detection, including heavily protected pages with strict Content Security Policies (CSP).

## üéØ Features

- **CSP Bypass**: Works on pages with strict Content Security Policies including nonce requirements
- **Shadow DOM Isolation**: Uses closed shadow DOM for maximum isolation from page scripts
- **Canvas Data Extraction**: Extracts content from HTML5 canvas elements using `toDataURL()`
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Ask questions and get intelligent AI responses 
- **OCR Integration**: Optional OCR processing for extracted canvas images
- **Local Backend**: Communicates with local Python server for data processing
- **Stealth Operation**: Avoids triggering `visibilitychange`, `blur`, or `focus` events
- **No Focus Stealing**: Does not interfere with page focus or user interactions
- **All Frames Support**: Works in main frame and all iframes (`all_frames: true`)
- **Multiple AI Backends**: Supports Ollama (local), OpenAI API, and intelligent fallbacks
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to simpler injection methods if advanced techniques fail

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install the Chrome Extension

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select this folder
4. The extension should now appear in your extensions list

### 2. Set Up the Backend (Optional but Recommended for AI)

The extension includes a Python backend with AI capabilities:

```cmd
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the backend server
python example_server.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000` and provide:
- **AI Question Answering**: Ask questions and get intelligent responses
- **OCR Processing**: Extract text from canvas images
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze and process extracted content
- **Multiple AI Backends**: Supports Ollama (local) and OpenAI API

### 3. AI Configuration Options

#### Option A: Local AI with Ollama (Recommended)
1. Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`
3. Start Ollama (it runs automatically)
4. The server will automatically detect and use Ollama

#### Option B: OpenAI API
1. Get an API key from OpenAI
2. Edit `example_server.py` and set:
   ```python
   AI_CONFIG = {
       'use_openai': True,
       'openai_api_key': 'your-api-key-here',
       ...
   }
   ```

#### Option C: Intelligent Fallbacks
If no AI backend is configured, the server provides intelligent pattern-based responses for common programming questions.

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`

### 3. Using the Extension

1. Click the extension icon to open the popup
2. Click "Inject Panel" to inject the floating UI into the current page
3. **Type your question** in the text area (e.g., "What is JavaScript?" or "How do I create a function?")
4. Click **"Send to Backend"** to get an AI-powered response
5. Use "Extract Canvas" to extract data from canvas elements and get OCR processing
6. Copy text or responses using the "Copy Text" button

### 4. AI Features Usage

**Ask Questions:**
- Type any question like "What is the DOM?" or "Explain CSS flexbox"
- Get intelligent responses based on your backend configuration
- Works with programming questions, general knowledge, and technical concepts

**Canvas OCR:**
- Click "Extract Canvas" to extract text from images on the page
- The backend will process the images and extract readable text
- Useful for capturing text from screenshots, charts, or image-based content

**Smart Detection:**
- The system automatically detects if your input is a question and routes it to the appropriate AI endpoint
- Provides confidence scores and source information for responses

## üîß How It Works

### CSP Bypass Techniques

The extension uses multiple techniques to bypass Content Security Policies:

1. **Content Script Injection**: Runs at `document_start` with high privileges
2. **Shadow DOM**: Creates isolated DOM tree that CSP cannot affect
3. **chrome.scripting API**: Uses Chrome's scripting API as fallback
4. **Inline Styles**: Uses `style.cssText` to avoid external CSS restrictions
5. **No External Resources**: All code is self-contained

### Stealth Features

- **No Event Interference**: Carefully avoids triggering page event listeners
- **Isolated Execution**: Uses shadow DOM with `mode: 'closed'`
- **High Z-Index**: Ensures panel stays on top without interfering
- **Minimal DOM Footprint**: Creates minimal DOM elements
- **Event Propagation Control**: Uses `stopPropagation()` on all events

### Canvas Extraction

```javascript
// Extract canvas data safely
const canvases = document.querySelectorAll('canvas');
canvases.forEach((canvas, index) => {
  try {
    const dataURL = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');
    // Send to backend for OCR processing
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle tainted canvas gracefully
  }
});
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### What This Extension Does

- Injects a floating UI panel into webpages
- Extracts visible content from canvas elements
- Sends data to local backend for processing
- Operates with user consent and awareness

### What This Extension Does NOT Do

- Access sensitive user data without permission
- Modify webpage content or functionality
- Transmit data to external servers (only localhost)
- Interfere with page security mechanisms maliciously

### Responsible Use

This extension is designed for:
- Educational purposes and learning
- Accessibility improvements
- Content analysis and processing
- Research and development

**Please use responsibly and in accordance with applicable terms of service and laws.**

## üîç Testing with Protected Pages

The extension has been tested against pages with:

- ‚úÖ Strict CSP with nonce requirements
- ‚úÖ `default-src 'none'` policies
- ‚úÖ Frame blocking (`frame-src 'none'`)
- ‚úÖ Script blocking (`script-src 'nonce-...'`)
- ‚úÖ Canvas-based content rendering
- ‚úÖ Focus and visibility change detection
- ‚úÖ Developer tools detection attempts

### Example Test Page

The included `blindat.html` demonstrates a heavily protected exam page with:
- Ultra-restrictive CSP
- Canvas-rendered questions
- Tab switching detection
- Focus loss monitoring
- Inactivity tracking
- DevTools detection

## üì° Backend API

The Python backend provides several endpoints:

### Health Check
```
GET /health
```

### Process Text
```
POST /process
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "Text to process",
  "timestamp": 1234567890
}
```

### Process Canvas Data
```
POST /canvas
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": {
    "dataURL": "data:image/png;base64,iVBOR...",
    "width": 800,
    "height": 600,
    "index": 0
  }
}
```

### Advanced Analysis
```
POST /analyze
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "content": "Content to analyze",
  "type": "exam_question|code_analysis|basic"
}
```

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

### Extension Settings

The popup interface allows configuration of:
- Auto-injection on all pages
- Stealth mode operation
- Backend server URL
- Panel visibility toggle

### Backend Configuration

Edit `example_server.py` to customize:
- OCR processing options
- Analysis algorithms
- Data storage methods
- API endpoints

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Injecting

1. Check if the page allows extensions (not `chrome://` pages)
2. Try the fallback injection method
3. Check console for error messages
4. Ensure content script permissions are granted

### Canvas Extraction Failing

1. **Tainted Canvas Error**: Canvas contains cross-origin data
2. **Access Denied**: Page prevents canvas data access
3. **No Canvas Found**: Page doesn't use canvas elements

### Backend Connection Issues

1. Ensure Python server is running on `localhost:8000`
2. Check CORS settings if accessing from different origins
3. Verify firewall isn't blocking connections
4. Test with `/health` endpoint first
